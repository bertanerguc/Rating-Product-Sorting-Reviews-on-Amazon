## üîß Key Features

### üõ† Tasks

1. **Calculate Weighted Average Rating**:
   - Compute a time-based weighted average to give more importance to recent reviews.
   - Compare the weighted average with the overall average rating.
2. **Sort Reviews**:
   - Generate new scoring metrics:
     - **Positive-Negative Difference**: Helpful votes minus non-helpful votes.
     - **Average Rating**: Ratio of helpful votes to total votes.
     - **Wilson Lower Bound (WLB)**: A statistical method for ranking helpful reviews.
   - Rank reviews using the **Wilson Lower Bound** score.

## üìà Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate Weighted Average Rating
- Use review timestamps to assign weights to reviews based on recency:
  - Reviews in the most recent quarter: **50% weight**.
  - Reviews in the second most recent quarter: **25% weight**.
  - Reviews in the third most recent quarter: **15% weight**.
  - Older reviews: **10% weight**.
- Compute and compare the weighted and unweighted average ratings.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Review Scores
- Create a new column `helpful_no`:
  - `helpful_no = total_vote - helpful_yes`
- Calculate scoring metrics for each review:
  - **Positive-Negative Difference (score_pos_neg_diff)**:
    - Formula: `helpful_yes - helpful_no`
  - **Average Rating (score_average_rating)**:
    - Formula: `helpful_yes / total_vote`
  - **Wilson Lower Bound (WLB)**:
    - Formula: Statistical calculation using the binomial distribution to rank helpful reviews.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Top Reviews
- Rank reviews by their **Wilson Lower Bound** score.
- Select the top 20 reviews to display prominently.
